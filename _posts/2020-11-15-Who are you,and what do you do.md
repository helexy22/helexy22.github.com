### Who are you,and what do you do?

I'm Helexy, and I'm in a fuzzy work direction，it can be said to be a [Urban planner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planner) or city data analyst.

### What hardware do you use?

I exclusively use [Lenovo V2000 Laptop](https://www.amazon.cn/%E8%81%94%E6%83%B3-%E5%B0%8F%E6%96%B0-V2000-Bigger%E7%89%88-15-6%E5%AF%B8%E6%B8%B8%E6%88%8F%E6%9C%AC%E9%AB%98%E5%88%86%E5%B1%8F-I7-4510-8G-1T-4G%E7%8B%AC%E6%98%BE-Win8-%E9%BB%91%E8%89%B2/product-reviews/B00PVCMNCA?reviewerType=all_reviews) with 16GB of RAM. Even if the weight is large and the endurance is poor, it still brings productivity in a fixed place. In 2021, I have added [ThinkPad T490](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadt/t490/22tp2tt4900) with 16 RAM, which is only used when I go out. The weight of 1.5kg and 5-hour endurance experience are great. 

### And What software?



[ArcGIS](https://desktop.arcgis.com/) for spatial analysis. It is essential for data analysis with  [Excel](https://office.live.com/start/excel.aspx) and [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/spss-statistics-software). It has become very common for advanced learning to use scripting languages such as [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) to handle spatial analysis.

As long as I can use the web, I generally don’t need an App. Under the conditions of a better user experience.

I use the [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Feishu](https://www.feishu.cn/ to organize memos and project management in life and work. [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) as my text stars  on my phone.When I switched to Android, I used [Pure Writer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.drakeet.purewriter&hl=zh) instead of Drafts.

I use the [Apple music](https://music.apple.com/) as ambient sound. It has no additional social burdens and robotic comments in mainland China. And it works well with [Shazam](https://www.shazam.com/), in iOS 14.2.

I am a [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://office.live.com/start/powerpoint.aspx)（Abbreviated as PPT ）fan，use PPT to do simple graphic design and make resume.

I use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/), and [Dida365](https://dida365.com/)  as GTD tools，one is cross-platform, and the other is web-only. I only use Dida365 on the office computer,which installed monitoring software. 

Any and all programming I do is extremely amateur hour and usually in [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) , [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),I also use IDE environment  like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and  [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=es).Although I am an amateur, I am used to writing Markdown documents and browsing Github open source projects.

 [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/cn/products/photoshop.html) and [CorelDRAW](https://www.coreldraw.com/cn/) will help me make thematic pictures.Recently I like to use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to draw some structure diagrams or flowcharts.

### What would your dream setup?

I am a minimalist believer,I want a big desktop, only a laptop and a big monitor, plenty of light and fresh water, in the circulating air. I also need a high-definition camera, I need online meetings and chat.

When I want to rest, I want to see moonlight or sunshine.
